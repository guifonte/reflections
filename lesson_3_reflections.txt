When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you share your code, or code it from other computers.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because if someone makes a change in the GitHub, you may see the change before modifying your repository.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork creates a copy of a repository in GitHub, clones creates it locally and branches creates a new label for a commit.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is that with it is possible to do a foward merge


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Sharing the code file. It would be harder but would not need to have git installed.
