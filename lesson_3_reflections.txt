When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you share your code, or code it from other computers.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because if someone makes a change in the GitHub, you may see the change before modifying your repository.
